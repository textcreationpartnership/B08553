            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable, and Right Reverend Father in GOD, HENRY Lord Biſhop of <hi>LONDON,</hi> AND One of His Majeſty's moſt Honourable Privy-Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT I preſume to lay theſe following Papers at Your Lordſhip's Feet, is out of the high Veneration I have to Your Lordſhip's Great Conduct and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (in which Your Dioceſs have been ſo long happy) and out of that deep ſenſe of Duty, which will always make me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb facs="tcp:191811:3"/> ſubmit to Your Cenſure and Correction, whatever Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures I ſhall take for the Good of that Church, to whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice You are pleas'd to deſign me.</p>
            <p>And how can it be, but that upon this occaſion I ſhould propoſe and endeavour ſomething more than ordinary for the Good of the Place I am going to? For tho' indeed the Glory of God, and the eternal Happineſs of the Souls of Men are Conſiderations ſufficient at any time to animate Chriſtians to ſuch Attempts, as ſhall conduce thereunto; yet when Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence places ſuch Governours at the Helm in Church and State, as being of a Publick Spirit, do themſelves most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly purſue ſuch Bleſſed Ends; and being eaſie of Acceſs, do with the utmoſt Candor and Condeſcention (of which truly Noble Excellencies, Your Lordſhip is an extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) give ear to the Overtures of Inferiour Perſons, upon the ſame Deſigns; it ſeems as if God did then intend to be propitious to the Undertaking.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, the whole Aim of what follows is to make a proviſion for the implanting ſuch Meaſures and Degrees of Chriſtian Knowledge, as it is requiſite every one who profeſſes Christianity, ſhould be acquainted withal, and that the Minds of Men may happily be deliver'd from that Ignorance wherein lies the ſtrength of Satan's Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Knowledge is the faireſt Ornament of the Soul of Man, and whoſoever is endowed therewith, let it be of what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, fails not of Reſpect amongst all ſorts of Perſons; but
<pb facs="tcp:191811:3"/> eſpecially Knowledge is then valuable, when it is in things of the greateſt Moment and Conſequence. And that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which I have endeavour'd in theſe following Papers to provide for, is ſuch, is too evident to need Proof or Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For why? It is a Knowledge that is converſant about the greateſt Objects, <hi>viz.</hi> God and our Selves; and that about the grandeſt and moſt concerning Truths relating to thoſe Objects. It is a Knowledge to which the moſt conſiderable of other Sciences are ſome way or other Appendent and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient: But above all, it is the only Knowledge which can Conduct us ſafe through the Mazes and Labyrinths of this World, to our Reſt and Happineſs in the other.</p>
            <p>Nor will the Advantages to Mankind of ſuch a Deſign as this be leſs conſpicuouus, if we look upon the contrary Evil from which it tends to deliver the Minds of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Divine things. For why? The Power of the Prince of this World, is by no other Character ſo muoh known, as by the Title of the Kingdom of Darkneſs. And what Sins and Miſeries are there, which this Ignorance and Darkneſs is not the fruitful Parent of? It were enough to ſet Ignorance out as the moſt dreadful Evil, to ſay that it is the cauſe of all thoſe Slaviſh, Barbarous, and Savage <hi>Superſtitions</hi> that are in the World.</p>
            <p>But alas, it is not of one ſingle Sin, or ſort of Miſery that Ignorance in Chriſtianity is productive; but it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parent of all thoſe fearful Crimes, and outragious Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes that are committed upon the Face of the Earth, and
<pb facs="tcp:191811:4"/> when it once prevails over a whole People, it is ſo fruitful in Miſery alſo, that the State of ſuch Men becomes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Emblem of Hell, as will eaſily occur to the Obſervation of any that are at all acquainted with the ſtate of the World, ſo as to be able to compare one People with another, with reſpect to their Knowledge of God and Religion.</p>
            <p>For Inſtance, let but any one compare the People of this Nation, amongst whom (praiſed be the infinite Goodneſs of Heaven for ſo invaluable a Bleſſing) the Light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhines with a Meridian Brightneſs; if we do but compare theſe with the Naked <hi>Indians,</hi> the African <hi>Cannibals,</hi> or rather with the <hi>Georgians,</hi> a Degenerate Race of Chriſtians in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi>'s Travels.</note> amongst whom the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God and Religion are in a manner quite extinct; and amongst our ſelves there are ſome tolerable degrees of Humanity, Honeſty, and Goodneſs; whereas the others are ſo much worſe for Bloodſhed, Luſt, Cruelty, Revenge, and whatever Brutiſh and Savage Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, than Wolves, Bears, and Tygers; inaſmuch as being Rational Creatures, they have greater Cunning and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of doing Miſchief one to another, than thoſe Bruits have.</p>
            <p>And indeed in any part of the World we ſhall find that proportionably to the Increaſe or Decreaſe of Chriſtian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, do Vice or Vertue make their Advances reſpectively; ſo that as on the one ſide innumerable are the Miſeries and horrid are the Sins, the Barbarities, Cruelties, Perjuries,
<pb facs="tcp:191811:4"/> Murthers, Adulteries, and whatever other Violations of the Laws of God, Nature, and Nations, that proceed from the bitter Fountain of Ignorance of the true Nature of God and Religion: So unſpeakable on the other ſide would be the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits conſiſting in Juſtice, Mercy, and Peace; in Piety to God, and well order'd Affections as to our ſelves, were but the World throughly enlightened with the Knowledge of God, and the true Nature of <hi>pure and undefiled Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now if we conſider theſe things, how ſtrange is it there ſhould be thoſe amongſt us, who, as much as they owe their Security and Happineſs at home, to the Influence that Religion has upon our Publick Laws and Private Actions; yet are perfect Enemies to the propagation thereof abroad. But yet it is not to be wonder'd, that ſome ſhould <hi>hate the Light, it is becauſe their Deeds are Evil.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more to 'em, but that the Day will come, when they will find their Omiſsions in promoting, or rather their Obſtructions to the Progreſs of Christianity, the moſt terrible part of all their Accounts.</p>
            <p>But God be prais'd, as Lukewarm in Religion as this worſt of Ages is, I muſt not forbear to acknowledge it to the Honour of ſome, that they have already ſhew'd themſelves to be of a contrary Spirit by their Liberal Benefactions to our preſent Deſign, by whoſe means we have been able to lay a good Foundation to our Parochial Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to ſend ſome over already into <hi>MARY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:191811:5"/>
            <p>And as our Succeſs is in a great meaſure owing to the Liberality and Countenance given to the Deſign, by ſeveral Great Men of Your Lordſhip's Order; and by Your ſelf in particular; ſo that God may long preſerve amongſt the reſt, ſo great a Patron of Learning and Religion, ſo firm a Pillar of our Church, and ſo great an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Your Sacred Order, ſhall be the Hearty and Devout Prayers of,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sirs,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving been ſo well acquainted, by being concern'd in a Parochial Cure my ſelf, with the Method of Indigent Travellers, who always make firſt to the Miniſter of the Pariſh; and beſides his own Charity, deſire him to recommend 'em to ſuch as are well diſpos'd Perſons therein; I preſume the more to apply to you in the ſame manner, in the behalf of your Brethren going abroad into the Plantations to ſerve the Great Maſter of us all, our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and who having a Zeal for his Work, want only thoſe means for the propagating of Chriſtian Knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> good and proper Books, without which it is ſcarcely conceivable how they ſhould be either furniſhed with a ſufficient meaſure thereof themſelves, or impart it to others. I have little reaſon indeed to doubt of your own Liberality in this matter, the Charity and Generoſity of the Clergy being ſo very apt upon moſt occaſions, to out go their Ability. And the Members of our Univerſities particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
<pb facs="tcp:191811:6"/> if we conſider the Noble Donations and Additions which have been made by them to their Libraries, Chappels and other Buildings, they will be found to have erected more Monuments of their Zeal for the Advancement of Learning and Religion in a few years laſt paſt, than any other Perſuaſion or Body of Men (not the Romaniſts excepted) have done in many Ages heretofore.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall we deſpair of a ſavourable Anſwer from thoſe to whom we would deſire your Application on our behalf, provided they are ſeaſoned with any tolerable meaſure of Zeal for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God and of true Religion, for thoſe who are really Pious, cannot but eaſily receive the Impreſſion, when they are given to underſtand that there is no Charity in the World whereby they can ſo much contribute to the Honour of God, and the good of Souls, as this; That it is an Apoſtolical Work to have an hand in converting Souls to God, and that there is no way whereby the Laity can have ſo immediate a hand therein, as that which is here offered to them.</p>
            <p>I could urge how that in agreat meaſure from the Colonies abroad, our Citizens and Merchants have had their prodigious Wealth, and that hither it is that the Countrey-Man and the Tradeſman do vend their Manufactures and Commodities; and it were but reaſonable to propoſe it alſo to the Conſideration of our Perſons of Honour and Quality, as a thing not unworthy their Reflection, that ſince the Diſcovery of the Plantations, their Rents have been advanced, and their Splendor increaſed treble to what their Noble Anceſtors before 'em were acquainted with. And upon all this, it were natural enough to expoſtulate with 'em; what reaſon there can be, that they ſhould reap all the advantages to themſelves from the Dangers and Fateigues of other Men, and repay nothing back towards their chiefeſt well-being.</p>
            <p>But that which I would deſire might be chiefly conſidered and ſuggeſted to all Ranks and Degrees of Men, is this, That as ſcarce any People have receiv'd greater Advantages from the Foreign Plantations, than we have done; and no Nation in the World, I am ſure, has a better Religion to requite them with, for the ſame than we have; yet to the no ſmall Diſcredit both
<pb facs="tcp:191811:6"/> of our Countrey and Religion, no Perſuaſion of Men upon Earth have been hitherto ſo cold and wanting to promote it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ropagating Chriſtianity, I can hear of little Charity of that nature that goes from hence; which, whether it may not have been a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for thoſe terrible ſtroaks of Providence that ſome have lately felt, and thoſe but as warnings, that they may not by ſuch an unconcernedneſs for the cauſe of Chriſtianity, provoke the Divine Indignation to follow the blow with greater, is no more than what becomes Chriſtians to conſider.</p>
            <p>Now I can ſcarcely believe that a People who profeſs ſo much Zeal, and that moſt deſervedly, for the Proteſtant Religion, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do, ſhould be ſo inſincere in their Profeſſions, and have really ſo little eſteem for it, as to be unconcerned for the ſame abroad; eſpecially in thoſe Colonies which are as much <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and as much the parts of His Majeſty's Dominions, as theſe Iſlands are wherein we live.</p>
            <p>Much leſs can I think, that the Merchants, a Rank of Men of as great Generoſity as any of what Quality ſoever, and who do daily ſignalize the ſame by many Noble Gifts to Pious and Charitable Uſes; and from whom it is expected to do more for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Religion in the Plantations, than others, it (being the Plantations which in ſo great a meaſure have enriched them:) Much leſs is it to be imagin'd, that they ſhould be unconcern'd for the propagation of Chriſtianity therein, but for want of being more put in mind of the neceſſity thereof, and of being excited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and give me leave to ſpeak it, of our frequent and earneſt Applications made to 'em to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I crave leave to ſay, for want of Applications to 'em by us; for ſo it is, that the Romiſh Clergy having heretofore in this Nation, and continuing ſo to do to this day, in other Nations, moſt groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed the Credulity of the Laity, by Preaching up nothing ſcarcely but the Merit of good Works; and that to ſuch a Degree, as
<pb facs="tcp:191811:7"/> to make a Donation to their ſort of Pious Uſes (as they would have 'em thought) ſufficient to attone for all the Atrocious Villanies of a moſt Flagitious Life; we on the other ſide, out of an exceſs of Modeſty, as little as we baulk other Duties, and forbear to warn our People of other Sins; yet it is rarely that we are found much to mind 'em of works of Piety (as thoſe we do here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote, are really ſuch) and to do which is a Duty as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily Incumbent upon all Men, according to their Ability, as any other Duty whatſoever, and the omiſſion as much a Sin. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and eſpecially it is ſeldom they are put in mind how much it lies upon 'em to contribute towards the ſupport and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Chriſtian Name: And that the ſlighting the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities which God hath given us of ſetting up the Banners of Chriſt's Kingdom, where Satan does ſtill ſolely govern the Minds of Men, is a great Sin; and indeed, ſince the Divine Providence has been ſo propitious to us in our Temporal Concerns and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, as to extend the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dominions to the Remoteſt parts of the Earth, ſuch an Ingratitude to God, as is not the leaſt amongſt thoſe National Sins we are guilty of, and are to Anſwer for.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs indeed, that where People will be ſo ſiniſter in their Interpretations of what we do or ſpeak, as to call our Diſcourſes and Perſwaſions to Works of Piety, a Preaching of our ſelves, and our own Intereſts, it is hard enough for generous Spirits, who ſcorn what does in the leaſt ſavour of Selfiſhneſs, to be found in ſuch Arguments. And therefore I believe it is, that tho' our Parſonages, and Vicarages do continually ſuffer greater Diminutions by far in their Dues, from the Sacrilegious Invaders of the Churches Patrimony, and from pretended <hi>Modus</hi>'s and Preſcriptions (not to ſpeak of groſſer Methods) than our poorer Vicarage Houſes do by their Dilapidations, yet it is ſeldom or never that any of us trouble our Auditories with aſſerting our own Rights, and in warning our People leaſt they <hi>rob God in his Tythes and Offerings,</hi> as careful as we are to Preach up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt 'em that Juſtice to one another which concerns the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their own <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum.</hi> The reaſon is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance
<pb facs="tcp:191811:7"/> we find in our ſelves to be thought, or ſo much as ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeek our ſelves in the Diſpenſation of our Miniſtry: And hence alſo it is not without difficulty that we can be perſwaded to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mankind with thoſe ungrateful Arguments which wou'd draw any thing from 'em towards the ſupport and ſervice of the beſt of Churches amongſt us. But here in the Caſe we are now upon, there is no danger of ſuch Imputations, ſince what goes into the Plantations goes too far from You, <hi>Reverend Sirs,</hi> to terminate upon your ſelves.</p>
            <p>But however, we are ſecure enough in the Nature of the thing here deſir'd, for with as evil an Eye as the World looks upon the Preferments of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy (not conſidering the inſupportable Charges appendant to the greateſt part of them) and hate to ſee us Rich, yet to do the Layty right, I never knew any of 'em envy us Books, Learning, Knowledge; much leſs can it be ſuppos'd they will, when the Books we deſire are of ſuch a Nature, and do ſo directly enable us to impart uſeful Knowledge and Inſtruction to themſelves, as the following Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue in the whole Compoſition of it, is deſign'd to do. So that the caſe of the Plantations we are thus Bold to commit to your Management, we do humbly conceive is what You may with a good Grace, and Aſſurance enough ſolicite in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>And indeed, ſince I am ſo throughly perſwaded, that nothing can ſo directly tend to encourage Good Men, and Lovers of Souls, to venture themſelves in the Labours of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as good Books; and nothing can ſo immediately tend to render 'em Good and uſeful when they are there, as the ſame. I muſt therefore conjure you my Brethren, as you will approve your ſelves to our Heavenly Maſter, to have had his Glory prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in your Eye, that you will aſſiſt with the utmoſt of your Power and Eloquence in the obtaining what you can towards the providing of theſe Libraries, as a principal Means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Intereſt of Chriſt's Kingdom.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:191811:8"/>
            <p>I cannot tell what Apprehenſions other Men may have of theſe Matters, but for my own part I am ſo fully perſwaded of the uſefulneſs thereof, that ſince it is not eaſie in ſuch Times of Publick Neceſſities as theſe are, to get Libraries for all the ſmaller Vicaridges of this Kingdom (as the Noble Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden,</hi> did ſo worthily and piouſly project) whereby the Miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might be in a Capacity to Inſtruct the People with ſound and ſolid Doctrine in all the Eſſentials and Neceſſaries of Chriſtianity; The next Good thing, even equal, if not beyond the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Vicaridges, I could wiſh for the good of God's Church amongſt us, is, that there were but a Library in every Deanary of the Kingdom, and that plac'd either in the Center of the Deanary, or rather in ſome Market-Town, where it lies convenient for the Clergy to borrow Books out of it, when at any time they ſhall have occaſion to Read upon any Important Point of Religion, in order to clear their apprehenſions therein, that ſo they might with Judgment and Safety to the Peoples Souls, treat thereof to 'em; and thoſe Lending Libraries having the Books mark'd upon the Covers to what Deanary they belong, and lock'd up in Book-Preſſes made on purpoſe to keep 'em in, and Repoſited with the Rural Dean, the Miniſter, or the School-Maſter of ſuch Town, they might with very little Trouble be ſent for on any Market-Day, and as eaſily return'd within a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Time, (as there ought to be a limited time for it, as a Month for a <hi>Folio,</hi> a Fortnight for a <hi>Quarto,</hi> and a Week for an <hi>Octavo.</hi>)</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, The having of theſe Libraries diſpers'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom, for the uſe of the Clergy, would moſt manifeſtly and directly tend to the good of the Laity; who in ſuch caſes might promiſe themſelves a full Inſtruction in all the Points of Faith and Practice, whereas with the preſent Proviſion, all that they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear are general Exhortations to Religion, and ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the Practice of the Duties thereof: But without a very conſiderable number of very good Authors, it is morally impoſſible they ſhould have their Judgments truly and throughly Inform'd in the Nature and Extent of all the Duties to God, their Neighbour
<pb facs="tcp:191811:8"/> and themſelves, which cannot be done without much Reading: Much leſs ſhall a Miniſter be able, without good Skill in the Scriptures, and being much converſant in ſeveral Critical and Dogmatical Writers, be able to explicate and inforce all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Principles of Chriſtianity; without the Knowledge and Belief of which, and a Vertuous Practice acted upon thoſe Principles, the greateſt Regularity in Manners cannot be call'd a Chriſtian Life, nor entitle thoſe that live, tho' never ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Rules of Morality, to a Chriſtians Reward: which two things being well conſider'd by the Laity, <hi>viz.</hi> That they can neither be duly Inſtructed in Faith nor Practice, except the Clergy ſhall be ſufficiently provided of Books for that purpoſe: And withal, that it is the buſineſs of a Paſtor, not only to Feed his Flock, with wholſome Inſtruction, but alſo to defend 'em from the Contagion of Erroneous and Heretical Doctrines, which cannot be done without a competent Skill in Modern Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and thoſe not a few; even the Laiety would then think themſelves extreamly concern'd to have ſuch a Proviſion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and uſeful Books made for the Clergy.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Clergy themſelves, I am ſo fully perſwaded of the Benefit to them, of theſe Lending Libraries, that they ſeem to me to be the moſt likely means, and to be in a good meaſure ſufficient, to reſtore even thoſe of the loweſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities in the Miniſtry, from both thoſe Evils, which the Author of the <hi>Contempt of the Clergy</hi> ſays, are the Cauſes of our Contempt, <hi>viz.</hi> Ignorance and Poverty. And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. As for Ignorance in our proper Calling, it muſt indeed of neceſſity cauſe the Contempt of thoſe who are found to be ſuch. In any Calling a Perſon is valu'd proportionably to his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Skill therein; eſpecially in ours. And yet I do not ſee how it is poſſible for moſt of us but to fall ſhort of a compleat Knowledge in the whole Body, even of Preachable Divinity, as the Caſe ſtands with moſt of us; for one Third of the Livings of <hi>England</hi> come not up to 50 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which I am ſure will afford but very little, if any thing at all, to purchaſe Books
<pb facs="tcp:191811:9"/> with, when Domeſtick Charges, and Publick Payments are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd; and yet without the Reading of ſuch Books, at leaſt, as are of more immediate uſe to inform ourſelves in all the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, that ſo we may be able to inſtruct others, how is it poſſible (now that Inſpiration is ceas'd) but that we ſhould be ignorant to our own extreme Diſgrace, and the infinite Prejudice of thoſe Souls committed to our Charge? And again, except we ſhall have a Collection of ſuch Books, either of our own, or ſomewhere near at hand, whence we may borrow 'em, how is it poſſible we ſhould ever read 'em?</p>
            <p n="2">II. And the having of theſe Lending Libraries near at hand, I do alſo humbly conceive, will contribute not a little, to prevent that other occaſion of our Contempt, <hi>viz.</hi> Poverty, at leaſtwiſe, as to many of us: For this I am very certain of, that many of the Clergy in Poorer Livings, who are Bookiſhly given (and 'tis pity that ever any ſhould enter into Holy Orders who are not of this Spirit) can ſcarce keep themſelues clear of the Bookſellers Accounts, nor Money in their Pockets for their neceſſary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, becauſe of their Charges that way; which yet I think are as much their Neceſſaries as Meat and Drink, which give Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment only to the worſer part of us.</p>
            <p>Well, and if there be any Truth in that other Imputation, as the Cauſe of our Contempt, which the Adverſaries of our Church are ſo apt to charge us withal: <hi>viz.</hi> The ſcandalous Immoralities, which perhaps it may be too true that ſome may be guilty of; I do humbly conceive that this Scandal alſo may be in a great meaſure remov'd, by the ſame means of having Lending Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For whence is it that many ſeek for Company and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion abroad, but for want of the better Society of good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Authors at home: The Truth of it is, there are a ſort of Writers which are traditionally handed down from one Old Study to another, who are not ſuch a good Humour'd and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting Society as to make one delight much in their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But what Man of Spirit or Education, had he a <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> a <hi>Tertullian</hi> or <hi>Cyprian;</hi> a <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> a <hi>Hammond</hi> or <hi>Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:191811:9"/> come to viſit him, would leave ſuch Men of Senſe for the Society of the Sons of <hi>Belial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to ſay, that our Acquaintance with ſuch Excellent and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authors, will render our Society when we do meet together ſuch as becomes Men of Education and Learning; will elevate our Thoughts and Diſcourſe above the vulgar and uſual Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, in which it is much below us to be found, will ſupply us with thoſe Notions and Matter for Diſcourſe, as will render us not deſpicable, but venerable amongſt thoſe we ſhall happen to converſe withal.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I look upon the thing of Libraries to be the great <hi>Deſideratum,</hi> even here in <hi>England;</hi> and yet ſo ſanguine am I, that I am fully perſwaded I could propoſe thoſe ways to the Reverend Clergy of the Kingdom, whereby they might be provided therewith with very little Charge to themſelves or others. But to let that paſs; and I ſhall think my ſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently happy, if I can accompliſh a Deſign of this Nature elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; the reaſon I ſo much inſiſt upon the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs</hi> of 'em here, is to prove the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> thereof in the foreign Plantations; for here ſome few of the Clergy are able to buy a ſufficient Stock of Books for themſelves, but it is very rarely that thoſe who go into <hi>America</hi> are in ſuch a Condition; for Men of Intereſts and Fortunes love their Native Country too well, to venture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abroad.</p>
            <p>But the great Objection againſt our Deſign, will be the charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs thereof, in which reſpect when the Catalogue is read over, it will appear almoſt impoſſible to be accompliſh'd. There are ſeveral Books laid down upon particular Heads, and the Charges of ſuch a Library for every Pariſh will amount to many Hundred, if not ſome Thouſand Pounds. But the Method I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to take in the diſpoſing of theſe Libraries, will take off very much from the Formidableneſs of this Objection; for whereas there are ſometimes a ſcore of ſeveral Authors preſcrib'd upon the ſame Subject, it is intended, that not above one or two upon every Point ſhall be alotted into each Private Library; and thoſe who will not be ſatisfied without reading all that has been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:191811:10"/> by Authors of any Eminency upon every Theological Head (whoſe Noble Curioſity, Induſtry, and Thirſt after uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I cannot but highly commend) thoſe Worthy Perſons may borrow of their Neighbouring Clergy the Books they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves want, and they again of theſe; by which means there will alſo this Good acrue, that hereby a mutual Correſpondence with one another will be maintain'd by the Clergy; a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence in <hi>Re Literaria,</hi> the moſt uſeful and nobleſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence in the World, and which will render 'em as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in Learning and Knowledge, as others are for their Wealth and Riches. And if over and above theſe leſſer Libraries canton'd into ſo many Parts, we can obtain but one General Library in the Province, conſiſting but of the whole ſet laid down in the following Catalogue: This is the utmoſt of our Expectation or deſires.</p>
            <p>And here in theſe general Libraries alone it is that we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Antient Writers, whether <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophers</hi> mentioned in the Catalogue. I thought fit indeed to ſpecifie the particular Tracts written upon the ſeveral Heads by thoſe Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Authors, as well as thoſe which have been made by Modern Writers, as the moſt likely means I could think of, in order to their being read by the Lower Form of our Clergy. For as it is the ſame thing to the Learned part of the World, whether ſome Manuſcripts and Pieces of the Antients be really and utterly loſt, or whether they be buried in duſt in unfrequented Libraries, till now that ſome Perſons of a Great and Noble Genius, are ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em out, in order to give us a Catalogue thereof: So the great Reaſon, as I apprehend, why the Lower Form of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are not more converſant in the Antient Writers, is becauſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perhaps are not much acquainted, that many of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects they have written upon, are the very ſame they themſelves do daily Preach to the People: Whereas for inſtance, he that conſiders that <hi>Tertullian, Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> have written upon Repentance, who amongſt us would not ride ſome Miles to a Publick Library to conſult the Senſe of thoſe Perſpicatious Writers before we put Pen to Paper our ſelves.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:191811:10"/>
            <p>And now Reverend Sirs, I muſt earneſtly requeſt your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in paſſing a favourable Cenſure upon what follows. I have had but very little leiſure, and was conſtrained to a very ſhort time to draw up this following Catalogue: And at the beſt do pretend to very ſmall Skill for ſuch an Undertaking; But being deſign'd for the Service of the Plantations by my Superiors, at whoſe abſolute diſpoſal I ſo much am, that I ſhould think it a ſin to diſpute their Commands into any part of the World, where I have any reaſon to think it may be to the Service of God's Church to be ſent by them; I did not know how I could be any ways ſerviceable in the Place I am deſign'd for, without ſending before me, or carrying over with me, for the uſe of the Church, I go to, ſome Proviſions of this nature.</p>
            <p>But now my Hand is in, if I ſhould find this part accepted, I do further deſign to draw out into a more particular Scheme, thoſe two great Conditions of the Covenant of Grace; <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Articles included in our Creed,</hi> which we are to believe; <hi>And the various and numerous Duties included in Obedience,</hi> which we are to practice; And in the ſame Method as before, to ſubjoin the ſeveral Authors of beſt account, both Antient and Modern, who have written upon thoſe more particular Subjects.</p>
            <p>And alſo to this Part, I would add a Liſt of all the moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, both amongſt the Antient <hi>Homilies,</hi> and Modern <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> which have been publiſhed upon all the foregoing Heads of Pulpit Divinity, whether General or Particular.</p>
            <p>And when I ſhall have thus far provided Directions to thoſe of my Brethren, I am likely to be concern'd with beyond Sea, as to give 'em an entire Scheme of what I humbly conceive more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately neceſſary for 'em to underſtand themſelves, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others in, in order to Salvation; I ſhould be glad if ſome abler Pen, one that can pretend to Univerſal Learning, would give us a draught of thoſe Studies, which thô not ſo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, are next thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> exceedingly uſeful to perfect a Divine, ſuch as the whole courſe of Hiſtory, both Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Civil; Phyſiology, and ſeveral other parts of Humane Litherature, which are of no ſmall concernment to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters
<pb facs="tcp:191811:11"/> of Chriſt's Church to be Maſters of: But if no one elſe ſhould undertake this part thô I have not Skill my ſelf, I have Zeal enough to attempt any thing, thô above my Power, for the good of God's Church, and the Honour of his Clergy, the great Intereſt of which, I think I can, and hope I ſhall be ever able to prefer to any of my own.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of Publiſhing the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, and Catalogue, is in hopes that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Hands of ſuch who are Piouſly diſpos'd, they may be thereby wrought upon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards the promoting the two beſt Things in the World, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> in thoſe Parts which are moſt uncultivated therewith, the <hi>American</hi> Plantations.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is ſcarcely to be imagin'd, that thoſe Perſons who are throughly ſeaſon'd with true Piety, and are ſenſible of the ineſtimable Benefit which they themſelves have received by the Preaching of the Goſpel (by which alone they are diſtinguiſh'd from thoſe Barbarous <hi>Indians,</hi> whoſe Spiritual Condition is truly deplorable; and whoſe Converſion is one thing herein aim'd at, as well as the Inſtruction of thoſe of our own <hi>Colonies.</hi>) It is not to be Imagin'd, I ſay, but that they ſhould be hearty Well-wiſhers to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:191811:12"/> and contribute ſo far as they are able, towards carrying it on. It was Emphatically ſpoke to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>When thou art Converted, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thy Brethren,</hi> Luke 22.32. For a Soul throughly Converted, and burning with a fervent Love to God, will not only wiſh well to the Labours of others, but by all poſſible means will it ſelf endeavour, that the Image of that God he loves, may be impreſt likewiſe upon other Mens Souls; and that all the World may joyn with him in the Adoration and Praiſes of that Bleſſed Saviour, from whom he does receive ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Benefits.</p>
            <p>Now, in reference to our Foreign Plantations, the Subject of our preſent Concern, I humbly conceive, there is ſcarcely any more effectual way to teſtifie our Love to God, or the Souls of Men, by promoting the Glory of the one, and contributing to the common Salvation of the other, than by imparting ſomething towards the providing of ſuch <hi>Libaries</hi> therein, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Clergy ſent thither, may be enabled to inſtruct thoſe People in the Doctrines of ſound Belief and good Morals; the two great conſtituent parts of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>For this in the firſt place, I will be bold to aſſert, That however ſome Perſons, whoſe Enmity to the Clergy proceeds from their want of Love and Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that God and Religion, to whom they do Miniſter (as is notorious, if we conſider the Principles and Practices of thoſe Men;) notwithſtanding, I ſay, ſuch
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:191811:12"/> are pleas'd to traduce the whole Order as uſeleſs, and a burden to the World; yet it is evidently owing to the Men of that <hi>Tribe,</hi> that Mankind has been ſo happily recover'd from the Ignorance, Barbarity, and Brutiſh Manners into which it was ſunk; and that Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Rapine and Violence have given way to Purity, Juſtice and Humanity in thoſe parts of the World where Pure and Genuine Chriſtianity is taught; Nay, and it is owing to them, that where Humane Sacrifices were once offered, now the <hi>Reaſonable Service</hi> that the Goſpel preſcribes, which is <hi>to live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly,</hi> has prevail'd in the World; and that where whole Provinces were Slaves to the Devil, they are now the Servants of God. And ſhould a Nation, through the heavy Judgment of Heaven, become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of a Learned and a Pious Clergy, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to the Malignant Principles of thoſe who hate the Profeſſion; Good God, to what Impurities, Rapines and Murders muſt ſuch a wretched People be inevitably expos'd! Such an ineſtimable Benefit to Mankind, are a Clergy that do throughly underſtand, and induſtriouſly preach the Genuine Doctrines of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Next, I preſume I may ſafely aſſume this, that as the Clergy are more or leſs uſeful to thoſe Excellent Ends of Improving and Perfecting the Minds of Men, accordingly as they are more or leſs Maſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that Divine Knowledge which they are to Teach others; ſo it is not poſſible according to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:191811:13"/> preſent Diſpenſation of Divine Providence, that they ſhould throughly underſtand it themſelves, without the help of ſuch Books as treat of all the Sacred Truths of Chriſtianity. For now the Goſpel being fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, <hi>Inſpiration</hi> is ceas'd, and Perſons of all ſorts, Clergy as well as Laity, are left to Study and Reading, as the only Means, whereby, together with God's Bleſſing, they can attain to that meaſure thereof, which is ſufficient to inform themſelves and others.</p>
            <p>And therefore Laſtly, from hence it does follow, that ſuch Charitable Perſons as ſhall contribute towards the furniſhing of the Clergy deſign'd for the <hi>Engliſh Colonies</hi> abroad, with ſuch means of Knowledge, as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, cannot but have a proportionable ſhare both in the Vertue and in the Reward of that Bleſſed Work, whereby God's Kingdom is exalted in the World, and the Devil diſpoſſeſs'd of that Uſurp'd Dominion he has gain'd over ſo great a part thereof. Such will in ſome meaſure, be accounted to have been <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and will partake in the Reward of thoſe who have <hi>turned many to Righteouſneſs,</hi> by carrying the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to other Nations.</p>
            <p>And who is it that is piouſly Ambitious of being high in the Favour and Love of God, and of being exalted to a higher Station amongſt the Bleſſed Saints above, that would not at the Charge of a Moderate Benefaction, be ſo Inſtrumental as this may render him, towards the Salvation of a conſiderable part of Mankind? The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> we do all know, are to <hi>ſit upon Twelve
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:191811:13"/> Thrones judging the Twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that they ſhall be thus Honoured above all Men, but becauſe they were the Grand Propagators of Chriſtianity, <hi>and ſpar'd not to ſpend, and be ſpent</hi> in that Service, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. to reduce Mankind to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of God? And may not then thoſe Perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a proportionable degree of Honour and Reward above their Brethren, who ſhall offer of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance towards the ſame Noble and Bleſſed End? Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, indeed of whatſoever kind it be, will have its Reward. He that gives Alms to the Poor, He that Cloaths the Naked, or Feeds the Hungry, will find ic upon his Account at the Day of Judgment. But then as there are different ways of doing Good; ſo to provide Spiritual Food for the Souls of Men, is a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of as much a more exalted Nature, as the Spirit is more Excellent than the Body.</p>
            <p>Nor will this Charity terminate only on the Minds of thoſe that receive it, but will alſo have a moſt happy Influence to the procuring of their Bodily Comforts, for whereſoever the Goſpel of our Saviour prevails, it takes off that Ferity of Nature whereby Mankind become Beaſts of Prey, even Wolves and Tygers, to one another, and renders 'em Benign and Kind to all thoſe who have to do with 'em; and ready to do all manner of good Offices to their Brethren in Humane Nature. So that you may ever obſerve, that proportionably as Divine Knowledge prevails in the World, in the ſame degrees do Barbarity, Rapine,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:191811:14"/> Violence and Brutality decreaſe, and Humanity, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Order gain ground amongſt Men. And if the Authors from whence this Knowledge is deriv'd, are not corrupted with ſuch Principles as undermine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality (which is viſible in the Writings of ſome ſort of Men) the tendency of Chriſtian Books, as ſuch, is to improve Mankind in all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, to a ſimilitude with the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves; and indeed to render 'em Partakers of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>This I ſay, if the Authors from whence this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is deriv'd, be themſelves good; for Men are generally ſuch in their Principles, Tempers, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as the Books and Company are with which they Converſe, ſince <hi>Evil Communications</hi> in either way <hi>do Corrupt good Manners:</hi> but ſuch as do truly repreſent the Nature of that Covenant we have made with God in our Baptiſm, and do ſhew us from thence, the indiſpenſable Obligation lying upon us to a Holy Life; ſuch as do ſet forth the Principles of our Religion as the moſt forcible Motives to live according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Right Reaſon, and the Improvements of Revelation; ſuch Authors as theſe do manifeſtly tend, not to Debauch the Manners, but to Improve the Morals of Mankind, to that degree, as to bring down a kind of Heaven here upon Earth, and to render the Inhabitants thereof Guardian-Angels to one another.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:191811:14"/>
            <p>And this has been the great Aim in that Collection of Books here Recommended, as proper to enable our Clergy to Advance the Bleſſed Work propoſed in thoſe Plantations where they are to Miniſter. It is hard to be anſwerable for every thing contain'd in all of 'em. There is no Humane Writing free from Faults or Defects in ſome kind or other; But however there are no Errors in any of thoſe Books here Propos'd, which the Orthodoxy of others in the Catalogue will not rectifie. And take 'em in the whole Bulk, they are thought to be ſome of the moſt uſeful in their kind, to give a competent Underſtanding of the whole Body of Chriſtianity, and all its Parts. And as it is endeavoured, together with the Catalogue of Books here exhibited, to give a Scheme of Chriſtian Truths in that Order wherein they do moſt naturally lie; ſo the very ſtudying of 'em in ſuch a Method, may probably tend, not a little to the Improvement of our <hi>American Clergy</hi> in Chriſtian Knowledge, and to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble 'em the better to Edifie others. For as the Study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Science incoherently, begets nothing but confus'd Apprehenſions of things in our own Minds; ſo it will render us incapable to give clear and adequate Repreſentations thereof to other Men.</p>
            <p>And indeed it ought not to be diſſembled, that this Catalogue is publiſhed with ſome deſign to help our Young Students in Theology, even on this ſide the Water, ſince it maybe a piece of Service to ſome of them, to direct 'em in the Choice of ſuch Books, as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:191811:15"/> will be of moſt neceſſary and immediate uſe to them in their Miniſterial Inſtructions to the People, and which yet by the brevity of the Catalogue may be had, (ſome one at leaſt on each Head) without any great and inſupportable Charge. True it is, there have been various Methods of Study given us by learned Men, with a Liſt of thoſe Authors they would Recommend to our uſe: But it is the general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that few or none ſeem to have Adapted their Catalogues to the <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Immediate</hi> Buſineſs of a Pariſh Miniſter, as he is one who muſt inſtruct his People in all things belonging to his Salvation; much leſs to the Circumſtances of the greateſt part of that Body, whoſe ſmall Livings, eſpecially if they have Families, will not afford 'em wherewith to Purchaſe a third part of the Books Recommended to them in thoſe Catalogues.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed, if they could buy them, would it be very agreeable to the Nature of their Buſineſs to do it; for either theſe learned Directors give us Liſts of all the Authors that have Writ upon each Subject, or at leaſt of as many as they have perus'd and read themſelves, and this generally through all the general parts of Learning, however remote and unneceſſary to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular buſineſs of a Preacher or Catechiſt; or if they have confin'd their Catalogues to ſuch Books as are more <hi>Immediately</hi> Uſeful and Practical, yet they do not ſeem to have deſign'd 'em in any great Order, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Rationale</hi> of their Catalogue may clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:191811:15"/> with reſpect to a Pariſh Miniſter, as if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thereby a Proviſion, eſpecially for a through and entire Information of Teacher or Hearer in all the neceſſary and eſſential points of Chriſtianity And hence it is that many Young Divines, if you come to examine their ſhelves, will be found either to have laid out what they could ſpare, in Books of a more remote concern, and thereby to have diſenabled themſelves to purchaſe thoſe of a more immediate Importance. Or if they have expended their ſmall Stock in Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divinity, yet their Collection will ſeem to be very <hi>Rickety,</hi> having a great redundance in Authors upon ſome points, and as great a deficiency on others. Whereas thoſe in the mean Livings by cutting off Superfluities, might be able by degrees to purchaſe one or two Books at leaſt, upon every of thoſe Heads of Doctrine wherein it is neceſſary they ſhould inſtruct the People; and for want of which, all the <hi>Terms</hi> of the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> are ſcarcely Preach'd over to them in many places, I fear, in the whole Courſe of ſome Mens Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>And probably it is from this Obſervation, that ſome have been ſo importunate with me to Print the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Catalogue of Books deſign'd for Parochial Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Foreign Plantations, upon which conſideration I hope, it will not be imputed to me, as Arrogance, to offer what looks like a Direction in this caſe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is to my Brethren of the loweſt Form in the Church that I do herein apply my ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:191811:16"/>
            <p>And yet ſo far am I from aſſuming to Dictate what Books, it may be ſufficient, even for the moſt Inferior Rank of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines to read, that I do thus far <hi>Retract</hi> what I have ſaid with reſpect to any advanced to Holy Orders in this part of the World, where good Literature does ſo much flouriſh, and makes ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in the value we put upon Men, that I do freely acknowledge it were much to be wiſht that every one of the Clergy here in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould <hi>Launch out far</hi> into the vaſt Ocean of Univerſal Learning. For beſides that we live here in a very Inquiſitive Age, wherein Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Ranks and Profeſſions have arriv'd to great Attainments in all the parts of Knowledge; and it is not a little indecent to ſee a Gowns-Man, whoſe very Garb denotes him one Devoted to Study, outdone by any ordinary Laik, in <hi>Philology, Philoſophy, Mathematicks, Antiquity,</hi> or any part of uſeful Learning (except by Perſons in their own proper Profeſſion, to whom it is as decent on the other ſide to ſubmit) beſides this, I ſay, the Buſineſs of a Divine is of that comprehenſive extent, that good Skill even in Nature, Mathematicks and Laws, which may ſeem moſt remote from his Buſineſs, is not only Acceſſary and Ornamental to his Profeſſion, but of exceeding great uſe for the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Proof of ſome of the principal Subjects he is to Diſcourſe upon to the People, and alſo for the Defence of the moſt <hi>Fundamental Articles</hi> of Faith, that he is to maintain againſt the <hi>Atheist</hi> and <hi>Anti-ſcripturist.</hi>

            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:191811:16"/>
            <p>The Knowledge of <hi>Nature</hi> affords the beſt, the plaineſt, and the moſt demonſtrative Proofs of the Exiſtence, and Providence of God, to the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Faith, and the Raiſing the Admiration and Devotion towards the Divine Majeſty, both of the moſt Intelligent and of the Meaneſt of the People. <hi>Mathematical</hi> Knowledge is in ſome meaſure neceſſary, to enable one to give a Rational Account of the Truth of the <hi>Moſaick Hiſtory</hi> of the Creation and Deluge; and to anſwer the Cavils and Exceptions of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and Half-learned Atheiſt, (as has in the Inſtance of the Ark, been unanſwerably done by Biſhop <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> and in the like Caſes bv other Pens.)

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:191811:17"/> give himſelf up to farther Enquiries into Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Learning, ſtill making this his Rule, that he ſpends moſt of his Time and of his Thoughts upon what is Eſſential and immediately neceſſary to Man's Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Terms of the Covenant of Grace; ſince to purſue any other Knowledge to the neglect of this, would in him be to gratifie a ſinful Curioſity.</p>
            <p>But as for thoſe who are to ſerve in the Plantations, I do no not at this diſtance foreſee the neceſſity of their being provided of more than ſuch a Sett of Books, as ſhall be of abſolute neceſſity to enable 'em to declare the whole Will of God, ſo as may ſuffice to the Information of Plain and Illiterate Men, that ſo they may be able with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking to his Converts, to call the Conſciences of thoſe committed to their Charge, to atteſt alſo to them, that they <hi>are pure from the Blood of all Men, not having ſhunned to declare unto them all the Counſel of God.</hi> Not but that we could wiſh to have one Library of more Univerſal Learning, to have recourſe to upon occaſion, in every <hi>Province,</hi> and ſhall eſpecially endeavour to have one in the College which is now Erecting in <hi rend="blackletterType">Virginia,</hi> by the Favour and Bounty of his moſt Excellent Majeſty and our late B.

            <p>But however, as it is fit we ſhould be contented with ſmall Beginnings, ſo we ſhall be deeply ſenſible

And therefore, in order to a compleat and exact underſtanding of Both, we cannot forbear here moſt importunately to deſire that our <hi>Indian</hi> Clergy ſhould be provided of ſuch Authors, as purſuant to the Method of our Church Catechiſm, may accordingly inform 'em in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and thereby enable 'em to inſtruct the People in all its weighty Parts, ſo as every Private Chriſtian may fully underſtand his Baptiſmal Vow, as well in the general extent of the whole, as in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Articles of every Branch thereof.</p>

                  <p>N. <hi>It will not be wondred at that ſo many Writers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jewiſh Antiquities ſhould be preſcrib'd, when it is conſidered that many Chriſtian Inſtitutions are derived by our Saviour and his Apoſtles from Jewiſh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages; nay, the whole Oeconomy and Government of the Church under the Goſpel is taken from the Synagogue, and carries an expreſs Analogy and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude to the legal adminiſtration of thoſe Times. So the Baptizing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren bears Relation to the Baptizing the Children of the Proſelytes, and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably to be Juſtified from that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage; the Lord's Supper anſwers to the Paſchal Lamb; Liturgies amongſt Chriſtians to Forms of Prayer amongſt the Jews; Presbyters and Deacons to Prieſts and Levites; the Twelve Apoſtles to the Twelve Heads of Tribes. And St.</hi> Clemens Romanus <hi>under the Title of High-Prieſt, Prieſts and Levites,</hi>

                     <hi>N.</hi> The chief uſe indeed of theſe Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances in the Original Tongues, is much the ſame as of Gloſſaries, and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordances of Things, that is, to find out the different Acceptations of the ſame Word, in order to clear an Obſcure or Doubtful Text. For in theſe Concordances every conſiderable Word of Scripture being preſented to the Eye in one View of all thoſe Places where it occurs; it will be eaſily gathered, by conſidering the Nature, Circumſtances, and Scope of theſe ſeveral Places, what are the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſenſes it will bear, and what it moſt properly ſignifies in any of thoſe, which by an ill rendring are made either Doubtful or Obſcure. But however this being a part purely Critical, for which not many of our <hi>American</hi> Paſtors may have leiſure, the want of theſe may be eaſily diſpenc'd with, and may be ſupply'd by the Gloſſaries and Concordances of Things before-mention'd. But Concordances in the Vulgar Languages are uſeful in another way, and neceſſary for all. To proceed then,</p>

And on the other ſide its Deſign being to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Kingdom of God, conſiſting in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true Holineſs, and withal to humble us with a ſenſe of our own Imperfect Righteouſneſs, by making us depend ſolely upon the Mediation of Chriſt for the Acceptance thereof to our Juſtification; This, I ſay being its Deſign, and Satan being therefore enraged, that his Uſurp'd Dominion ſhould be wreſted from him: So it is, that the Church-Militant is ever ſince, through his Inſtigation and the Malignity of his Angels in that Unhappy State, that like the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it muſt be defended with a Sword in one hand, whilſt built with a Trowel in the other: All which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, it is very requiſite that our our <hi>American</hi> Paſtor ſhould, next to his Knowledge in the Holy Scriptures (out of whoſe Materials he is to Build) be provided of thoſe defenſive Weapons wherewith he may be inabled to oppoſe the Gain-ſayers to that Chriſtianity he is to

                  <p>N. <hi>There is nothing of mightier Importance in our Inquiries after Truth, and towards a through underſtanding of any Inſtitution, than to have fixt in our Minds a determinate and diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Deſign it drives at. This is what our Bleſſed Saviour preſcrib'd as the moſt ſure and certain way to diſcover the Erroneous Doctrines of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Hereticks, bidding us to</hi> beware of falſe Prophets, which come to us in Sheep's Clothing, but inwardly are Ravening Wolves, <hi>and telling us, that we might</hi> know them by their Fruits, <hi>that is, by the tendency of their Doctrines, which if they were naturally productive of ſuch ill Fruits, as Chriſtianity is deſign'd to deſtroy, muſt therefore neceſſarily be Erroneous or Heretical. And this very Rule has a peculiar Aptitude in it to diſcover the three great Errors, which have ſo much corrupted Chriſtianity at this day,</hi> viz. <hi rend="blackletterType">Popery, Antinomianiſm, and</hi> 
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Socinianiſm; Popery being a Superſtition that makes the neareſt approaches to the Pagan Idolatry, and tends to Indulge Men in Impurity;</hi> 
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Antinomianiſm being a Scheme of Divinity alſo that manifeſtly undermines a Holy Life: And</hi> 
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Socinianiſm tending to make us value our ſelves too much upon it, by taking us off from our dependance on Chriſt, for the Acceptance thereof. All which conſider'd, As there is the greateſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that before we enter upon our Enquires into the whole Body of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine, we ſhould be fully poſſeſs'd with this Notion concerning it, that the whole and adaequate Deſign thereof is to deſtroy the Power of Satan, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and Sin, and reſtore and advance the Kingdom of God, and inſtead of an external Legal Righteouſneſs, to implant an inward and real Holineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men: And withal, ſo to Humble the beſt of us, as to make us depend ſolely upon the Mediation of Chriſt with God the Father, for the Acceptance thereof to our Juſtification; ſo eſpecially this Notion of Chriſtianity ought immediately to precede our Reading the ſeveral Syſtems of the differing Parties amongſt Chriſtians at this day: In moſt of which, as there are ſeveral un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Hypotheſes advanc'd; ſo without this Teſt, we ſhall not ſo eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between their Heterodox and Orthodox Opinions. Not to ſay, that by thus having our Eye always on the Deſign of Chriſtianity, and by bringing every particular Doctrine delivered to us, as Chriſtian, to this Touchſtone, we ſhall know how to judge concerning thoſe that are true, which are more, which leſs conſiderable in the Body of Chriſtian Doctrine, that ſo we may be able accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to put a different value upon 'em, a thing of no ſmall conſequence to the Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Chriſtian Church.</hi>

Such Contempt, I ſay, in the People, of our Ghoſtly Counſel and Advice, has made this part of Penitential Divinity to be ſo much uncultivated by our Engliſh Divines. The Romiſh Church indeed, as they are in nothing more voluminous that in this, ſo they abound in Confeſſories and Penitentials: But inſtead of tying up the Conſcience to the ſtricteſt Rules of Holy Living, the more peculiar buſineſs of a Caſuiſt, by their great Doctrine of Probability, and ſome others of the like nature, their Moral and Caſuiſtical, tend as much as their Doctrinal Divinity, to encourage Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, and to make Mens Conſciences eaſie in a courſe of unrepented ſins; as is evident to thoſe who have either read their own Authors, or what is Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to our hands, out of 'em, even by the Janſeniſts, Men of their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>

                     <hi>And what then would they have impos'd upon thoſe Miſcreants of our days, who without force or compulſion; nay, who contrary to our Laws, and in defiance to their Authority and Penalties, do every day, out of the malignity of their own Hearts, deny the everlaſting God, and their only Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; And that with all the ſpight and ſcorn, not only in Tranſient Diſcourſe, but in lewd Songs, and prophane Plays, (which being edg'd with Wit, and flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, do corrupt the Minds of thouſands, beyond their power ever afterwards to retrieve from the horrid Principles they have infus'd into 'em) what laſting Penances I ſay, would they have impos'd upon ſuch? Would they have look'd upon it as a wonderful Honour forſooth, to God and Religion, to have ſuch whiſper privately upon their Death-bed a few Penitential Confeſſions within their Curtains? and then upon this would they adminiſter to them the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Reconciliation, tho' they offer not ſo much as a publick and ſolemn Recantation of thoſe impious Principles they have ſo induſtriouſly propagated, to the infinite Diſhonour of God, and Deſtruction of thoſe Souls for which the Son of God died? Would they not at leaſtwiſe have required ſo much towards the Reparation of the miſchief done,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tantum fiat converſio ut qui Deum non Agnoſceba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ipſi eam jam aliis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtremus. <hi>Amb. de pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit.</hi> Lib 1.</note> 
                     <hi>as a publick and ſorrowful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Declaration to all the World of the ſincerity of their Converſion? True it is, as our Church complains in the Office of Commination, that the Primitive Diſcipline, as much as it is to be wiſh'd, is not eaſily to be reſtor'd; but however it is ſtill, and ever will be in our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:191811:53"/> Power to declare to Fornicators, Adulterers, Perjur'd Perſons, Murderers and Blaſphemers, as ſhe does, the true ſtate of their Caſe, and to let 'em know the Judgments of God hanging over ſuch, as do not in the higheſt meaſure they can, make Reparation for the Diſhonour they have done to God, and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they have brought to other Mens Souls. This we may do by letting 'em know, in the Diſcourſes we make, and the ſtate we give of true Repentance, that ſuch a Reparation towards God is as neceſſary, as Reſtitution to Man, to render their Repentance acceptable. For tho' it be commonly ſaid in the modern way of ſtating the Nature of Repentance, that God not ſuffering by whatever we can do againſt him, Remiſſion will follow upon our hearty Sorrow and Amendment only, but that our Neighbour being really damag'd by the injuries done to him, Reſtitution muſt be part of that Man's Repentance, who has any wiſe wrong'd him in his Reputation or Eſtate; yet, with Submiſſion to better Judgments, I do humbly conceive, that God is as capable of ſuffering Injury from us as Man. All the Malignity indeed of Men and Devils can't make Him ſuffer in his Eſſential Perfections, in his Nature and Happineſs, as to Himſelf; but his Honour and Authority in the World, which was ſo dear to Him, that He ſent his only Begotten Son into it to Reinſtate Him in his Dominion over it, may certainly be impair'd by the ſcandalous Impieties of deſperately Wicked Men. And therefore if the Good Name of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, of which he has been Rob'd by us, muſt as openly, that is, to all the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of putting Him right in the Opinion of the World, be juſtifi'd by a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, as it was formerly Defam'd by him; for much greater Reaſons muſt a Blaſpheming or Profane Atheiſt be put upon the ſolemn and moſt open Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Repentance, and upon ſuch a Recantation of his Principles and Practices, as will reach as far to the ſetting God right in the Opinions of Men, as his Lewd Speeches, Songs, Plays, or Books have fled abroad to the Diſhonour of Him. Thus a late (and till then an unhappy) Gentleman, Sir</hi> Duncomb Colcheſter <hi>did; and till ſuch others as he was, do the like; as, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the utter loſs of Publick Diſcipline, it is ſtill in, and cannot be out of our Power to refuſe Private Communion to ſuch enormous Sinners; ſo I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive we ought not to give 'em the Sacrament of Reconciliation till they have done it. But to proceed,</hi>

                  <p>N. <hi>Theſe latter have provided De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions for the ſeveral Hours of Prayer, which is both a Primitive, and moſt excellent Method of Devotion. As to its Antiquity, ſee</hi> Cardinal Bona de Divina Pſalmodia, <hi>who C.</hi> 3, &amp;c. De varia Diei &amp; noctis Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſione, <hi>does treat upon that Subject. And as for the excellency of this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Method of Devotion, I ſuppoſe it muſt needs tend to maintain alive the Fire of the Altar, to have it ſo frequently ſtir'd up; beſides, that the determinate Times call upon us to that, which, if left to be perform'd at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, will be in great danger of being forgot or neglected, through the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of buſineſs. And I could wiſh that there were ſome ſhort Ejaculations and Prayers collected out of our</hi> Pſalms <hi>and</hi> Collects <hi>for the Country People, which by the frequent hearing of 'em in our Divine Service, would be eaſily got by Heart. And as the ſhortneſs thereof would make it eaſie for 'em to lift up their Souls in Pious Thoughts, without Interuption to, nay in the midſt of their worldly Imployments; ſo that conſtant Exerciſe of ſuch Devotion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:191811:66"/> every third Hour in the Day, would elevate their Spirits Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and keep 'em up in a perpetual Elevation above the things of this World. But to proceed, there only wants to compleat the Proviſion of Books I would deſire for Devotion, and with that the firſt Theological part of our Parochial Libraries, to have ſome of the beſt Sacramental Devotions, of which the Piety of Learned Men of our own Church have furniſh'd us, of late Years, with ſuch excellent choice;</hi> as,

            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:191811:74"/>
            <p>
               <q rend="margDblQuotes">In the Year 1691. His Majeſty having graciouſly thought fit to take the Government of <hi>Mary-Land</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Hands, and the Province into His imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Care, in <hi>May</hi> 1692. An Act of Aſſembly paſſed for the Eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there, and for dividing the Ten Counties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into five and twenty Pariſhes, each of which are endowed with a Competent Maintenance for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; But the Execution of that Act was in a manner wholly neglected, till it pleas'd His Majeſty to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Government on the moſt Worthy and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſon <hi>Francis Nicolſon,</hi> Eſq; who ſince his Arrival in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1694. with an indefatigable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Zeal to Promote His Majeſty's Honour, the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Good of the whole Province, hath Reviv'd and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforc'd the ſaid Act by another additional one, for the Increaſe and Maintenance of Religion, hath Collected the Arrears, and is now Building ſeveral Churches, beſides one fine Church at <hi>Annopolis</hi> in <hi>Arundel</hi> County, with a Parſonage-Houſe to every Church; towards all which, His Excellency, the Council, and other Inhabitants of the Province have Generouſly and Largely Contributed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margDblQuotes">And that a perpetual Succeſſion of Proteſtant Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be provided for the Propagation of the True Chriſtian Religion in the ſaid Colony; His Excellency hath by the Conſent of the Councel and Burgeſſes in Aſſembly, Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:191811:75"/> a Law, Veſting a Power in certain Truſtees for Erecting one Free-School in each County: One of which is already begun at <hi>Annopolis,</hi> and is endow'd with 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> for the Maintenance of one Maſter and two Uſhers, for the Inſtructing the Youth of the ſaid Province in Arithmetick, Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and all uſeful Learning; but chiefly for the fitting ſuch as are diſpos'd to Study Divinity, to be farther Educated at his Majeſty's College-Royal in <hi>Virginia,</hi> in order upon their Return, to be Ordain'd by the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Suffragan, Reſiding in the Province, both for that purpoſe, and to Superviſe the Lives of the Clergy thereof; for whoſe Support alſo at the Requeſt and Recommendation of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, His Excelltency hath ſettled a Fair and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Maintenance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This may be ſufficient to ſhew ſuch as are diſpos'd to Good Works, and whoſe Duty it is to be Diſcreet and Prudent in ordering their Charity to the beſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as well as to be Bountiful according to their Ability; that here are a People as wel diſpos'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Benefit by a Learned and Induſtrious Clergy, as can be wiſh'd or deſir'd. And therefore to induce So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Serious and Studious Young Divines to go to the Foreign Plantations, and to Qualifie 'em to Anſwer the Ends of their Miſſion, I could not think of ſo proper a Means, as to provide them, each with a Collection of Choice and Uſeful Books; and to perpetuate an Uſeful Clergy there, to fix theſe Parochial Libraries in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:191811:75"/> Parſonage-Houſes, for the perpetual Uſe of thoſe who ſhall ſucceed them.</p>
            <p>And ſurely a more ſuitable encouragement to Men of Good Parts and Inclinations, to go upon ſo Bleſſed a Miſſion ſcarcely can be thought of; for as it is Good Books alone which will encourage the moſt Studious, Vertuous, and conſequently the moſt Uſeful Perſons to go over; ſo it is an Encouragement that is in a manner neceſſary to be provided in the Foreign Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; Since few or none at their firſt going over, are in a Condition to provide themſelves therewith: And when they are there, Books are not to be met with by thoſe who ſhall be able buy 'em; and yet without a Competent Proviſion of ſeveral Uſeful and Neceſſary Books, (I cannot forbear often to repeat this) it is Morally impoſſible that any ſhould be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to Inſtruct their People.</p>
            <p>And now that ſuch excellent Works are begun and carry'd on by an excellent Governour, and well diſpoſed People, what a happy Conjuncture is this for Perſons who are Piouſly diſpos'd, to give their helping Hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch Bleſſed and Glorious Deſigns, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of True Chriſtian Knowledge and Practice in Places formerly ſo much uncultivated therewith? Surely, if <hi>he who Converteth a ſingle Sinner from the Error of his ways, ſhall hide a multitude of ſins,</hi> What abundant matter of Comfortable Reflection upon a Death-Bed ſhall that Perſon lay up, who ſhall Contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:191811:76"/> providing of the moſt Proper and Genuine Means, next to the Divinely Inſpired Writings, of Converting many poor Souls, not only in this, but in all future Generations, even <hi>ſo long as the Sun and Moon endureth.</hi>
